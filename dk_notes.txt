# uname -r; uname -a
# cat /proc/version
# cat /etc/issue
# cat /etc/debian_version
# lsb_release -da
# hostnamectl

# isovfy command to verify the integrity of a iso9660 filesystem
# cannot fix though because it is supposed to be read-only

# /etc/apt/sources.list has mirrors and can be modified to get non-free packages, ex:
# deb http://httpredir.debian.org/debian/ wheezy main contrib non-free
# apt-get update && apt-get install firmware-realtek

# Sometimes the minnowboard will not reboot with the sudo reboot cmd
# and gives the following output over serial
[  493.725542] watchdog watchdog0: watchdog did not!
[  494.450202] reboot: Restarting system
# This then requires a hard reset either by unplugging and plugging
# back in the power or by holding the power button until it shuts off
