This README is primarily a pointer to the script that actually has all of
the information about what the importance of each file is in line with
the commands of the script.

Look at dosetup.sh for the details.

It is important to note that some of the files that are copied into /etc
are specifically configured for the Minnowboard and may not behave the
same if placed on another board.
